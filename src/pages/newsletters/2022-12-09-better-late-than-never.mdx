üëã G'day!

I am really glad to once again me writing to you!

Back from the void - I know, I know... I started this newsletter / update with such passion and commitment, and then seemingly just dropped off the face of the planet.

Let me catch you up.

## What happened?

That's a bloody good question. First off - I just want to thank those that reached out. I didn't get back to all of you, but please know, I read every email and I appreciate the thought so much. It meant, and means a lot. ‚ù§Ô∏è I am blessed to have a community of people who care.

The simple answer to this question: I was dealing with some pretty serious health issues. I'll spare you the details, but it was a few months of searching for answers, with what felt like an uncertain future. Luckily, I am blessed with a group of supportive friends, family, and of course, my loving wife.

This really lead me to tire of most things, and I needed to focus the small amount of energy I had each day to spending time with my wife and two greyhounds, and working to put food on the table. Hence, the radio silence - everything else took a back seat; this newsletter, 12 startups in 12 months, everything that wasn't my family.

However; I'm so relieved to say that I finally have answers, and am recharged once more. I have been yearning to write this letter, and let you know all of the dreams that I had over the last few months that I now get to bring into reality.

## 12 Startups.

New year, new me is how the saying goes, right?

I'm going to be attempting 12 Startups in 12 Months again next year. I learned a lot trying it the first half this year, and I want to take that learning into the next chapter.

I'm not waiting, though. I have already started building Airproxy - a tool that is helping businesses use Airtable in production; fearlessly.

It's not launched yet, however I am excited to say that we already have our first few business customers using it in production; and I'm not doing this alone.

My co-founder, Luke Bone, is here to help me with the marketing - something that I am foolishly helpless with. I'm excited to see just how far we can take this, and all the other crazy ideas that we'll have together.

I'll be talking more about Airproxy in the coming weeks. üòâ

## 24 Hour Builds

Last time I wrote you, I teased a new series that I was working on; a series focused on building startups, proof-of-concepts and minimum viable products in 24 hours or less.

The inspiration for this has always been helping others see that creating experiences and value for others doesn't, and shouldn't be daunting. Granted, I can't promise that these will be Facebook-scale ideas, however I hope that people will be able to see how these ideas prove that experimenting with startups is accessible, fun and will give it a go.

Now that I have a bit more head room - this is a go.

Building Airproxy, I tweaked my formula for creating these startups so that they'll work better in the format needed for the series. Next up... episode #1.

## A Massive Thank-you

I said it before, but I'll say it again. Thank you. ‚ù§Ô∏è To my wife, to my dogs, to my family, friends and to you.

One of the things I truely missed over the past few months was building startups, and writing about it here, and on my website. And now, I get to do just that; again.

Here's to 2023, and all the crazy things we're going to do together.

I hope you're in good health, and if not, you're on the journey to it.

Blessings,

Dan Ferguson
