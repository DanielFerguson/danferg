## Concept to Production!

G'day, and welcome to my newsletter. If you were able to attend, thank you for coming to my workshop, Concept to Production.

I had a blast sharing my journey as an entrepreneur, and my process for coming up with ideas, the importance of validating, building and then shipping your work.

As promised - here are the slides! I've included the presenter notes as part of the download. If you have any questions about the slides, questions that we didn't get a chance to discuss at the event, or if you need help with your idea(s), reach out!

## ðŸ’¡ Ideas

I'm currently working on the first article of five, where I will be diving deeper into the topics of the talk. The first article this week will be about ideas - how to practice coming up with ideas, ways of coming up with original ideas and some life hacks to become an idea machine.

I'll send an email when it's ready to go, however it will be available under Articles on my website, [danferg.com](https://danferg.com).

## ðŸ“š Extra resources

In my talk I mention about a few sites that can help you create businesses easily and quickly - even if you don't have technical skills. If you wanted to know my top no-code sites, here they are:

- [Carrd](https://carrd.co/)
- [Typeform](https://www.typeform.com/) (my personal fav)
- [Webflow](https://webflow.com/)
- [Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/)

A speaker that I mentioned in the talk was Simon Sinek, specifically his "Start with why" TedX talk. I strongly recommend putting this on and having a listen.

## Burnout, let's talk about it.

Mental health is no joke, and it can be incredible hard thing to balance with life, entrepreneurship and work.

Burnout has been something I've met more than once, and is something that I hope you never need to come across. However, it's best to be prepared, know the signs and catch it early.

As much as our community, rightly or wrongly glorifies hustle culture, your mental health should always come first. I'd love to know what you think of the, whether you've experienced burnout and if so, how you overcame it.
