description: Starting a business is time consuming and stressful. Thats why I built Observer, a platform designed to help you focus on the important tasks. Know instantly when your site goes down, how long it has been down for, and what caused it to crash. Meaning that you aren’t going to wake up every morning, scrambling to make sure that you’re still live.
