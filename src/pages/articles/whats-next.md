## What's next?

The definitive decade — pretty much a waste of an invaluable chance so far.

We've experienced first-hand the devastating effects that await us. As they're becoming more frequent, more exacerbated, our leaders seemingly are attempting to crawl their way to the finish line of 4 degrees by the end of the century.

I often bitterly joke with friends and colleagues that natural disaster recovery and relief is becoming one of the most stable industries to be; and how soul-crushing that is to see unfold before our eyes as we experience frequent wildfires and islands crying out to deaf ears to help stop their lives from being washed away.

### So, where do we go from here?

This is something that I can't stop thinking about. I remember starting 2020 with the idea of trying to become a leader for the definitive decade. Still, as I take a tally of my personal and professional actions over the past two years, I have indeed fallen short.

My focus has been more on myself and my family. Please do not hear that I am saying that is a bad thing in any way, shape or form; nor am I attempting to demonise self-care. However, the time has come that I make a pivot in my focus to helping in whatever capacity I can and to help steer us away from what seems to become more and more our inevitable fate.\*

\*Please do not read this as I am pivoting away from my family life. Family is first and always will be for me. As I keep family first, I need to refocus my priorities, other than family, to protect what is most important to me; family.

### Why am I thinking about this so much?

As some of you may know, I recently became a husband to the most amazing woman in the world. As horrible as the past year and a half have been, it's been a time that I have enjoyed spending with my wife.

Being in the IT industry, I have been incredibly fortunate to have been able to work from home, seemingly only becoming busier as the months go on. Between leading projects and teams, working on Helping Group, creating side-projects and trying to Upskill, being close to my wife every day has been an absolute blessing.

However, as with all serious relationships, the talk about kids come up. Now, we had discussed this well before we got married (definitely a good idea) — but as we face more and more disastrous events which grow worse and more significant by the month, I can't but help to wonder whether I want to bring children up, only for them to suffer through the consequences of our actions (or lack thereof).

I'm not alone in this either — surveys show that many others have a similar fear for their future kids, and even some have remorse for having children in the first place. I'm not in a position to go into the profound impact that this skipping of a generation could have on society, but it does keep me up at night.

### What steps am I going to take?

Well, that's an excellent question — and to be honest, I'm not quite sure yet. I want to play to my strengths, understand what I'm good at, where I can bring people together, and the areas that crazy talented people are not already addressing; because, as dire as it seems, I am amazed at all of the excellent work very devoted people are doing around the world.

Over the last few days, I've been taking inventory of the skills and resources in my possession. It was incredibly awe-inspiring how Australia rose to the challenge during the Black Summer bushfires, the event that kickstarted the Helping Group. I believe that fundamentally people are good and want to do good things; sometimes, the part that can be tricky is the how.

Watch this space. There are several projects that I will be focusing more intently on with the Helping Group (and other orgs/groups) that may aid in my newly refocused vision of my life. Also, a few other projects that I've been tinkering within the background may make it easier for all of us to have a significant impact on the world around us and to be able to capture and tell that story.

There is so much good in this world — and given the challenge, I believe we can overcome.

Please reach out to me if you have any ideas along these lines that you want help with — fleshing out concepts, turning ideas and dreams into actions and milestones; I am here to help.
